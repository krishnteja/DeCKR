# TypeScript-Babel-Starter

# What is this?

This is a small sample repository that uses Babel to transform TypeScript to plain JavaScript, and uses TypeScript for type-checking.
This README will also explain step-by-step how you can set up this repository so you can understand how each component fits together.

# How do I use it?

## Building the repo

```sh
npm run build
```


### Run the build task

```sh
npm run bundle
```

## Type-checking the repo (you shouldn't need to do this)

```sh
npm run type-check
```

And to run in `--watch` mode:

```sh
npm run type-check:watch
```
